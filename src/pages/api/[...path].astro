<StarlightPage frontmatter={{ title: "Docs-only environment" }}>
  <p>You've tried to navigate to <code>/api/{path}</code>, which is an endpoint or
  route served by another part of the application stack.</p>

  <p>If you are a user of the API, and seeing this in product, please immediately
  notify us on discord - something has gone very wrong, and part of the server
  likely fell over.</p>

  <p>If you're working on the docs in a local environment, this is expected -
  navigate back out with the sidebar.</p>
