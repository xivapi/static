Without the broad community of developers that has formed around FFXIV since its
release, and the uncountable hours put into building and maintaing the tools and
ecosystem we've come to expect, this API simply could not exist.

XIVAPI makes use of, is, and will always be open source. Many of the projects
associated with it can be found in the [github organisation].

[github organisation]: https://github.com/xivapi

## Behind the Scenes

These projects are directly used by, or form part of, XIVAPI itself.

[<Icon name="github" class="inline-icon"/> xivapi/static](https://github.com/xivapi/static)
: The website you're reading this on! Supplementary pages, including
  documentation and utilities, are served as a static site built using Astro.

[<Icon name="github" class="inline-icon"/> ackwell/boilmaster](https://github.com/ackwell/boilmaster)
: The API server itself, responsible for everything under `/api`. Boilmaster has
  been written from the outset to form an extensible and maintainable platform
  that can power XIVAPI for years to come.

[<Icon name="github" class="inline-icon"/> xivdev/EXDSchema](https://github.com/xivdev/EXDSchema)
: The default excel schema used throughout the API. Without EXDSchema and the
  prior art of the SaintCoinach schema, finding and utilising the content found
  in sheets would be significantly harder.

[<Icon name="seti:graphql" class="inline-icon"/> Thaliak](https://thaliak.xiv.dev/)
: The service that powers automatic version discovery throughout the API. With
  Thaliak, we can be sure that the API remains up to date with the latest game
  data.

## Alternatives

XIVAPI is not perfect for every use-case - and doesn't try to be! There is an
incredibly broad selection of alternative tools and services available from
across the FFXIV developer community. The list below is a small selection of
these that may be better suited to what you are trying to achieve.

### Lodestone Data

FFXIV's official website, Lodestone, has publicly accessible pages with
information about characters, free companies, and the like. A few libraries
and/or services are available that can read this information for use.

- [xivapi/nodestone](https://github.com/xivapi/nodestone): TypeScript, library or server.
- [xivapi/godestone](https://github.com/xivapi/godestone): Go, library.
- [xivapi/NetStone](https://github.com/xivapi/NetStone): C#/.NET, library.

You can also write your own library using the shared css selectors found at
[xivapi/lodestone-css-selectors](https://github.com/xivapi/lodestone-css-selectors)

<details>
<summary>Didn't the API use to support Lodestone?</summary>

Yes, it did. Unfortunately, this meant that every request that hit the Lodestone
came from the API, rather than an individual consumer. Despite efforts at the
time, downstream overuse of Lodestone data lead to increasingly high error rates
in responses. Eventually the API was completely blocked by Lodestone.

There are no current plans to re-introduce this functionality.

### Local Game Files

The API is primarily intended for use on the web, where game files aren't
readily accessible. If you know your code will have access to an installation of
the game, using a game data library will likely prove significantly faster and
more capable than the API.

[<Icon name="github" class="inline-icon"/> NotAdam/Lumina](https://github.com/NotAdam/Lumina)
: C#/.NET. The most broadly used game data library in the community. Supports
  many game file formats, and offers a generated class library for ergonomic
  consumption of sheet data.

[<Icon name="github" class="inline-icon"/> ackwell/ironworks](https://github.com/ackwell/ironworks)
: Rust. The data library powering XIVAPI. Modular, with support for common file
  formats and reading directly from game patch files.

### Exploration

While access to data is great if you know what you're looking for, it can be
daunting to look through. A few tools collate and/or provide an interface for
research and exploration of the data available.


[<Icon name="github" class="inline-icon"/> NotNite/Alpha](https://github.com/NotNite/Alpha)
: Alpha is a modern data exploration toolkit, containing a variety of tools for
  navigating game data.

[<Icon name="external" class="inline-icon"/> Godbert](https://github.com/xivapi/SaintCoinach/releases/latest)
: Data exploration tool primarily focusing on sheets. Part of SaintCoinach -
  while Godbert is a useful tool, it's strongly recommended to use Lumina if
  building a new project in .NET.


[<Icon name="github" class="inline-icon"/> goaaats/ffxiv-explorer-fork](https://github.com/goaaats/ffxiv-explorer-fork)
: One of the older tools, FFXIV Explorer remains a no-frills tool for navigating
  game file content.

[<Icon name="external" class="inline-icon"/> ResLogger2](https://rl2.perchbird.dev/Downloads)
: Centralised repository of all known asset paths in the game. Used widely by
  many of the tools and services above.

### Runtime

For data not available from static game files or lodestone, it may be possible
to build the project as a plugin, where runtime information from a game session
can be used in real time.

[<Icon name="external" class="inline-icon"/> Dalamud](https://dalamud.dev/)
: Dalamud is the predominant plugin ecosystem for FFXIV, and is an excellent
  starting point for building runtime tools and utilities.
