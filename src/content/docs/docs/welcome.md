description: An introduction to XIVAPI and its features.
---

XIVAPI is a comprehensive and modern web API for Final Fantasy XIV (FFXIV) game
data. From action tooltips to entire database applications and everything in
between, XIVAPI provides a powerful and reliable data source with the
information you need.

If you have any questions not covered in the documentation, or intend to use
XIVAPI in a production environment, it's recommended you join
[the Discord server](https://discord.gg/MFFVHWC). Maintainers and frequent users
of the API are regularly around to help, and any live service announcements will
be posted there first.

## Features

XIVAPI offers access to FFXIV data from anywhere with an internet connection.
It's a bit like a game install in the cloud - if it's shipped in the client,
we've got it.

Highlights include:
- **[Guaranteed stability](/docs/guides/pinning/):** Ensure data doesn't change
  until you're ready to update.
- **[Full-dataset search](/docs/guides/search/):** Every single field is
  available for search and filtering.
- **[Web-ready assets](/docs/guides/assets/):** Assets exposed in browser
  friendly formats, ready for use.
- **[Built in the open](/docs/software/):** The API and its dependencies are completely OSS. Join in!

## What It Isn't

The API offers a view of the data found in the game files - this notably does
_not_ include any information about players or their actions.

If you're looking for runtime data, there are a few adjacent projects that may
offer what you need listed on [the software page](/docs/software/#alternatives).
