Asset endpoints provide access to game files, converting them into readily
consumable file formats.

Game version pinning is supported for all asset endpoints. As assets do not have
any direct connection with sheet data, there is no need to pin a schema.

## A Word on Caching

Asset responses contain the converted asset file itself - effectively allowing
for the "[hotlinking]" of the resulting file.

**This is encouraged!** Serving assets directly through XIVAPI makes it easy to
keep them up to date between game versions, and can save a significant amount of
disk space on a site-by-site basis. The API has several layers of caching in
place to minimise undue load on the underlying asset service.

In saying this, please ensure that you are making use of the cache behavior we
provide. All asset endpoints include [`ETag` headers][etag] in responses, and
will respect [`If-None-Match` headers][if-none-match] from clients.

Many web clients, including all browsers, will handle this behavior on your
behalf. If you're not sure, please reach out and we may be able to help check if
it's working.

## Fetch Assets

Requests for an asset can be made using the asset's path within the game files,
and a format for the asset to be converted to. While technically valid requests,
many path/format combinations are nonsensical, and will return an error -
there's no _sensible_ way to format a 3D model as a PNG!

`/api/1/asset?path=ui/loadingimage/-nowloading_base01_hr1.tex&format=png`
<ImageFallback src="/api/1/asset?path=ui/loadingimage/-nowloading_base01_hr1.tex&format=png"/>

Game paths can be found through a number of tools, including XIVAPI itself -
[icon fields] in sheets will include paths to the associated icon asset in the
response. Many other [XIV data tools] also facilitate finding the file path
you're looking for.

The accepted file formats is a dynamic list, and will expand as needs arise.
Check the [API reference][assets reference] for an up to date list of what is
supported.

## Compose Maps

For reasons associated with how maps function in the game, they are regularly
split across a few files, and must be merged into a single image to look
correct. To make this process simpler, the map asset endpoint is available, and
performs this composition automatically when needed.

`/api/1/asset/map/s1d1/00`
<ImageFallback src="/api/1/asset/map/s1d1/00"/>

At time of writing, the appropiate map IDs can be found in the `Map` sheet, or
through exploring the `ui/map` game file directory.
